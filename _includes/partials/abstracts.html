                <p>Google has pioneered the usage of containers at huge scale. </p>
                <p>Learn how we designed our systems to handle insane traffic loads 
                    on our six services with more than 1 billion of users, 
                    orchestrating complex, globally distributed applications,
                    and how we made this powerful infrastructure 
                    and tools available for customers wanting to embrace the power of DevOps and Cloud computing.

                    failures and updates</p>

                <p>Congratulations, your app is deployed to production and running! But
                    wait, how do you ensure it stays running? There will be node failures,
                    network failures, software bugs, and updates trying to prevent this.
                    This talk will explore how DC/OS is both robust and self-healing, and
                    how DC/OS keeps your application available despite such failures,
                    application updates and varying workloads.

                <p>We sell travel services to more than 10 million customers worldwide in 15 languages across 35 countries, through hundreds of micro-services.

                </p><p> What happens if you challenge the way you deliver your products with a new infrastructure based on Kubernetes?
                    You’ll have to face classical developing, deploying and monitoring paradigms and bring everything to an entirely different level. It will also have to kept in mind that the business expects continuous delivery of new features without impact on the final customers experience.

            </p><p> We will not hide the failures, the problems and the wrong assumptions we made along the way, but we will celebrate lessons learnt and the goal we achieved; allowing us to boost time-to-market and reliability of our systems.</p>

                in production and how Amazon EC2 Container Service (ECS) can be used to reduce the operational burdens,</p>
                <p>and we will give an overview of the core architectural principles underlying Amazon ECS.

                    We walk through a number of patterns used by our customers to run their microservices platforms, to run batch jobs, and for deployments and continuous integration. We will also demo how to define multi-container applications with Docker Compose and deploy and scale them seamlessly to a cluster with Amazon ECS.</p>

                <p>Thinking about containers and how they are empowering you and your workflow you might realize that the real advantages of containers are not residing in the fact that they are the definition of OS level virtualization but that in being just a consequence of a whole ecosystem born around them.
                    This talk explores the possibilities in term of hardening and portability given by different combinations of OS and Hardware virtualized container runtimes by providing ideas and working examples.</p>

                <p>Docker si propone come uno strumento comodo e utile per semplificare la gestione dell'infrastruttura di applicazioni e servizi.
                    A causa della eccessiva rapidità di sviluppo e di alcune scelte architetturali, lo hanno reso uno strumento non adatto a tutti gli utilizzi. Nei casi reali introduce notevole complessità, alle volte non giustificata, poichè spinge all'utilizzo di tutta una serie di strumenti aggiuntivi non compresi all'interno di Docker per gestire l'infrastruttura. Nel talk esploreremo pro e contro di alcuni scenari di utilizzo e sfateremo anche qualche mito legato all'hype e alle "mode" del momento su questi temi.</p></blockquote>

                <h5>Mixed VMs and Containers workloads with Kubernetes</h5>
                <p>Real world production systems have heterogeneous workloads, that can require multiple layers of orchestration.
                    Not all the workloads are suitable to be containerized, and very often containers run on virtual machines scheduled by a cloud-scheduler (AWS, OpenStack, GCloud, etc).
                    Managing and maintaining this kind of infrastructures on-premise (or in hybrid scenarios) could have lot of operations and maintenance costs and risk.
                    In this talk we will present how Kubernetes can be used to schedule mixed VM and Docker workloads reducing operations and maintenance costs and risks.
